<h1 class="text-center my-4 px-4">The Quest for the Legendary Bloxy Cola</h1>
<main class="w-50 mx-auto">
    <p>
        This is a solo passion project I've been working on for a while now, and
        still am today. It's a turn-based RPG inspired by Pokemon where you
        travel the world with a companion in search of a mystical artifact, and
        it's my love letter to the classic era of Roblox that I grew up with.

        It features a simple storyline, cutscenes, and even a
        creature-collecting mechanic!

        I've managed to garner a small community around it, with it having
        almost 600k visits! Even some small Youtubers played it:
