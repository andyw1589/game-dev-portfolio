        This was a capstone project for CSC301 (Introduction to Software Engineering).
        Completed in a group with five other students in the class, made for
        Engineers Without Borders Toronto. It is a mobile app version of EWB's
        "Green Revolution" workshop, in which you play as a Punjabi farmer
        making decisions and buying certain products to maximize your wheat
        yield. Its aim is to educate users on the effects of technology on
        farming and global food production.
