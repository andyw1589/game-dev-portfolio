        This was a capstone project for CSC404 (Introduction to Video Game
        Design). Completed in a group with three other students in the class, in
        collaboration with U of T Music and Centennial College. It is a short 3D
        platformer game where you play as an axolotl named Skippy trying to
        escape captivity. It earned an honorable mention for best art design at
        the Level Up Showcase 2024.
